<h1 id="h1-tools">Chapter 2 - Tools</h1>

<p>
In this section additional tools are summarized that can
help to build a web book.
</p>


<h2 id="editor">2.1 Graphical Editors</h2>

<p>
The book files can be edited manually with a text editor,
requiring some basic HTML knowledge. The disadvantage is
that there are always two phases: (1) Input the text with HTML mark-ups
and (2) inspect the rendered text in a web browser.
</p>

<p>
A convenient alternative is the open source
web editor <a href="http://www.bluegriffon.com/">Blue Griffon</a>.
It is available for Windows, Linux, Mac. For Windows, only a zip-file needs
to be downloaded (no administrator rights needed). The editor allows a Word-like input,
or a pure textual input (in the same way as a text-editor with HTML syntax highlighting),
and it is possible to switch between the two.
The most often needed commands (&lt;p&gt;, &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;) are directly
provided in the tool bar. One just has to remember to use
&lt;em&gt; (="!") and &lt;strong&gt; (= "!!") for <em>italic</em> and
<strong>bold</strong> (there are buttons in the tool bar for them):
When clicking on the button for "bold" (= "B") an ugly &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;
construct is generated. In the "Wysiwyg" mode, BlueGriffon spell checks the document and therefore English language errors are at once visible.</p>

<p>
The next figure shows a screenshot of BlueGriffon:
</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption id="fig-bluegriffon">Figure 2-1: Bluegriffon screen shot</figcaption>
  <img src="resources/media/bluiegriffon.png"><br>
</figure>


<p>
Still another option is to use the <a href="https://atom.io">Atom text editor</a>
with the plug-in <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-html-preview">atom-html-preview</a>.
In this case, there is an online rendering of HTML5 with Javascript
(so one sees nearly in real-time the rendered change when the HTML5 text is modified).
</p>

<h2 id="TextEditors">2.2 Text Editors supporting Mathematical Symbols</h2>

<p>
HTML text can also be directly written with a text editor. Most text editors
have support for HTML syntax highlighting, so that the text displays well.
When writing equations with jqmath (see section xxx) Unicode characters are used
to define most mathematical symbols. It is very convenient to see these
characters in the text editor. Independent of the text editor used, it is then
important to use the "right" font in order that the text editor can display
the Unicode characters. There is no font available for all Unicode characters.
On <a href="http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_unicode_fonts.html">this web page</a>
a discussion of such fonts is present and the DehjaVuMono font is recommended:
"<em>DejaVu has significantly more Unicode symbols than other popular fixed-width
fonts such as {Courier New, Sans Mono, Miriam Fixed, Lucida Console, Lucida Sans Typewriter}</em>".
Furthermore, recently the <strong>Hack 2.0</strong> font was released, that is based
on DejaVu and is claimed to be specially designed for programmers.
You can download the (free, open source) fonts from here:
</p>

<ul><li>Hack font: <a href="http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/">http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/</a></li>
    <li>DejaVuMono font: <a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page</a>.<br>
	    Download the <code>dejavu-fonts-ttf-2.35.zip</code> file and use file <code>DejaVuSansMono.ttf</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
I have tried both and they seem to display a similar set of Unicode characters.
Especially nearly all characters used by
<a href="http://mathscribe.com/author/jqmath.html">jqmath</a>
are displayed.
I just recognized one important difference: DejaVuMono displays the
middle dot point "·" whereas the Hack font doesn't display it
(displays a blank character instead). Since this symbol
is used as mathematical symbol, it seems more meaningful to use
the DejaVuMono font.
</p>

<p>
Under Windows you need adminstrator rights to install a font.
Just click on the font file, e.g. on <code>Hack-Regular.ttf</code>,
and then click on the <em>Install</em> button. Afterwards, this font
shows up in the font menus of the programs on your computer,
such as in Word or Notepad++.
</p>

<p>
On Windows my preferred text editor is <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>.
No administrator rights are needed when using the <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/repository/6.x/6.8.3/npp.6.8.3.bin.zip">Notepad-zip package</a>
installer. By default, Notepad++ (tried it in version 6.8.3) uses the "Courier New" font that does
<strong>not</strong> display many of symbols used in jqmath. Changing the font under
"<em>Settings / Style Configurator / Global Styles</em>" to "<em>Hack</em>" does not help.
One has to select <em>Language</em> "</em>HTML</em>" and then use as Font name "<em>Hack</em>".
</p>


<h2 id="vector-graphics">2.3 Vector Graphics with SVG</h2>

<p>
The Web standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">svg</a>
defines vector graphic images. It is directly
supported by FireFox and Chrome browsers.
The open source tool <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> has native support for svg
(= images defined in Inkscape are stored in svg format) and can convert such
an image to many other formats. When storing an image, it seems most portable
to use "File / Save as / Plain". Furthermore, to get the right "bounding box"
in the generated svg-file, use "File / Document Properties / Resize page to drawing or selection"
and select some additional margins around this bounding box as shown in the
next figure (= 5 pixels on every side additionally added):
</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption id="fig-inkscape-document-properties">Figure 2-2: Inkscape document properties to define the bounding box</figcaption>
  <img src="resources/media/inscapeDocumentProperties.png"><br>
</figure>

<p>
The next figure shows a screenshot of Inkscape with the "moving mass" drawing
(the outer rectangle is the "bounding box"):
</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption id="fig-inkscape">Figure 2-3: Inkscape screen shot</figcaption>
  <img src="resources/media/inkscape.png"><br>
</figure>

<p>
The above vector graphics defined in Inkscape can be included
into a web book in the following way (the "width" attribute
defines the width of the vector graphics in pixels):
</p>

<pre>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mass that is pulled with a constant force&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;img src="resources/media/MovingMass.svg" width="300"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>


<p>
It is rendered as:
</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption id="60378249">Figure 2-4: Mass that is pulled with a constant force</figcaption>
  <img src="resources/media/MovingMass.svg" width="300"><br>
</figure>

<p>
With Internet Explorer 9 (and probably with other renderers as well)
the "width" attribute of svg-files is not
correctly interpreted: The figure is displayed in "natural" size and
the "width" attribute is used to cut/clip the figure.
In such cases, it is best to not use the width attribute but provide
the figure already in the "right" size:
</p>

<pre>&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mass that is pulled with a constant force&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;img src="resources/media/MovingMass.svg"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>

<p>
which is rendered as
</p>

<figure>
  <figcaption id="60374249">Figure 2-5: Mass that is pulled with a constant force (without width attribute)</figcaption>
  <img src="resources/media/MovingMass.svg"><br>
</figure>


<h2 id="validators">2.4 HTML and CSS Validators</h2>

<p>
It is easy to make HTML and/or CSS markup mistakes. The browsers are often silently
ignoring or "somehow" fixing the errors. It is therefore useful to validate the HTML-files.
The official validators of the W3C consortium are:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload">HTML validation</a></li>
<li> <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_upload">CSS validation</a></li>
</ul>
