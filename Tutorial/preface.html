<p>
The goal is to describe a book with several HTML5 files and 
use a simple command line tool (makeWebBook) to add missing
pieces to these files (like section numbers and navigation bars)
and to generate a "table of contents" file that links to all sections
and subsections. The result is a <strong>web book</strong> that
has all the advantages of web-technology, and still follows
the traditional approach of scientific and technical books to
structure the content. For example, it is then possible to state:
"see the details in section 3.4" and this will be a link to the
appropriate information. In standard HTML pages it is awkward to
define such cross references and therefore many technical descriptions
on the web are not as convenient as they could be.
</p>

<p>
The generated web book can be either used directly in a web page, or
it can be zipped, downloaded on a computer, unzipped and then inspected
locally in a browser.
</p>

<p>
There are many other approaches how books, and especially scientific and
technical books, can be built for the web. In <a href="chapter_04.html">Chapter 4</a>
<strong>several alternatives</strong> are shortly sketched, with their pros and cons.
Note, the obvious choice, <strong>epub3</strong>, has the severe disadvantage
that neither commercial nor open source tools are yet good enough 
for editing or rendering the needed web standards (HTML5, svg, webgl, javascript),
as compared with the much better and more powerful
rendering engine of Firefox.
