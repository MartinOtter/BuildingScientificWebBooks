<div class="headline">Building Scientific Web Books with makeWebBook</div>

<main>
<h1 id="Appendix_A">Appendix A - makeWebBook Program</h1>

<p>
In this section the makeWebBook programm is shortly sketched.
It is implemented in the
<a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> programming language from Google.
The reason for this is explained in the next section.
I used additionally the (simple) Integrated Development Environment
<a href="https://github.com/visualfc/liteide">LideIDE</a>
which makes developing with Go very convenient and fast.
</p>

<h2 id="sec-the-go-progamming-language">A.1 The Go Progamming Language</h2>

<p>
The programming language <em>Go</em> is developed since 2009 by Google.
Its current version is 1.5 (from August 2015). I used Go to implement the  makeWebBook
program for the following reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li> Go is <em>very portable and cross-plattform</em>:
     Go does not use static or dynamic link libraries. Instead always just
     one executable (for different platforms) is generated. Therefore,
     sending or downloading this executable to someone else is sufficient
     to just use the program on the respective platform.
     It is orders of magnitudes simpler to build and ship a Go program
     as, say, a C, C++, or Python program. For example, this project could have
     been also implemented in Python. But it is difficult
     (and outside of my capabilities)
     to provide a distribution of a Python based program that can be installed
     and works at once on every target environment.</li>

<li> <em>Very simple to build an executable</em>. Go has no build-mechanism
     and not static or dynamic libraries.
     The Go package handler just generates the binaries of the used
     packages automatically in the background and links all together.</li>

     <li> The third party Go package <a href="https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery">goquery</a>
     provides similar features and a very convenient usage as the Javascript library
     jquery. It is based on Go's net/html package (to parse HTML files)
     and on the third party CSS Selector library
     <a href="https://github.com/andybalholm/cascadia">cascadia</a>.
     Package goquery allows to read and <em>analyze HTML documents in a very simple way</em>,
     especially the files for a web book as needed in this project.</li>

<li> Go is a <em>statically typed, simple, yet powerful language</em>. It has a "C" like syntax
     but is more powerful as "C" and much simpler to use. It is possible to learn "Go"
     within an afternoon (just follow <a href="http://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">A tour of Go</a>)
     and write productive code afterwards.
     The Go specification is only available as a web page. When printing it (version 1.5 from Aug. 2015),
     it has a size of around 100 pages (but using large fonts; so effectively around 60-70 pages). Compare: <br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C++ (version 11): 680 pages<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java (version SE 8): 760 pages<br>
     Of course, this just gives an indication how simple "Go" is with respect to C++ and Java,
     but it is also clear that C++ and Java are much more expressive and more powerful as Go.</li>

<li> <em>Simple to understand the code of others</em>. When inspecting code from others
     (say the packages shipped with Go), it is rather straightforward to understand the code.
     Some years ago I learned a bit <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>
     and was impressed from its expressivenes.
     But understanding Scala code from other programmers
     (that utilizes the more advanced Scala features like
     overloading of special characters, e.g. for very effective parsing)
     is impossible for me.</li>

<li> <em>Feels like a scripting language</em>: Due to the fast compiler (needs only a few
     seconds to build an executable, at least after all used packages have been compiled
     once) one can write code in the IDE, click on "Build & Run" and nearly immediately
     get the result of the program. Furthermore, when initializing variables explicitly
     in a declaration, then the <em>type of a variable</em> need only to be defined when defining
     function arguments and when constructing dynamic data structures. For example:<br>
     <pre>actualTime   := time.Now()<br>timeAsString := actualTime.Format(time.RFC3339)</pre>
     declares two variables, but no type information has to be given
     (<code>actualTime</code> is a structure and <code>timeAsString</code> is a string)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Go has the following <em>drawbacks</em>:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Executables are large</em>: For example a simple "hello world" program
     has a size of around 1.6 Mbyte. The makeWebBook executable has a size of
     about 6 Mbyte (of course, if you would ship a Python "hello world" program in
     one installer with everything included, it would be much larger as 1.6 Mbyte).</li>

<li> <em>Limited number of packages</em>: Although there are quite a lot of packages
     provided by the Go language team and third parties, the number and functionality
     is small as compared to the huge number of libraries provided by the Python, Java,
     or C++ community. Especially, it seems that the Go team does not provide any packages
     for graphical user interfaces.This means before starting a Go project one has to
     carefully evaluate, whether enough ready-to-use packages are available for the
     respective task.</li>

<li> <em>No exception handling</em>:
     Error handling is a bit tedious because after every call of a program one has
     to have an if-clause to inquire the error-flag. It is a pity, that no
     (simple) catch/try error handling is available.</li>

<li> <em>No generics or templates</em>:
     Go has no support for generics or templates. This is understandable in order
     to make a simple language</li>

<li> <em>Garbagge collector</em>: Go automatically handles dynamic memory
     with a garbagge collector. This gives simple, safe code, but has a space
     and time overhead.</li>

<li> As with all languages designed purely by computer scientists,
     <em>support for arrays is very weak</em> (as compared to languages
     like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran 2008</a>,
     <a href="http://www.mathworks.com">Matlab</a> or
     <a href="https://www.modelica.org/">Modelica</a>). The native support is a bit better as in other
     (computer scientist) languages due to array slicing support and to
     give more control for re-sizing an array in an efficient way.
     Futhermore, as always in computer scientist
     languages, indexing starts at 0 (for an engineer it is unbelievable to
     have four elements E1, E2, E3, E4 and access the <em>third</em> element E3 by
     <em>index 2</em>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The alternative to Go would have been to use the
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> language from Mozilla.
The design seems to be similar (e.g. also the Rust executables are large).
I did not spend too much time on a comparison. The major reason to use Go was
because it is from Google and the syntax of Go looks nicer to me
(on first view Rust looks a bit like a functional programming language and
I do not like this syntax and the very short abbreviations; e.g. in
Modelica a function is called "<code>function</code>",
in Go it is called "<code>func</code>"
and in Rust it is called "<code>fn</code>". Rust does not have garbage collection,
but it is still claimed to be "safe", and
has support for generics).

<h2 id="sec-the_go_implementation-of-the-makewebbook_program">A.2 The Go Implementation of the makeWebBook Program</h2>

<p>
The program consists of two phases:
</p>

<ol>
<li> In a first phase all files defined in configuration.json under "SectionsFileNames" are
     read and analyzed with functions of the goquery package. As a result two data structures
     are constructed:
     <ul>
     <li> <em>BookStructure.Sections</em> is made to constructed afterwards the
          "Table-of-Contents". It contains the structure of the whole document in a
          hierarchical form (independently in which file an element is stored).
          Especially, there is an entry for all section, figure, table and
          equation elements. In this phase, the numbering is checked and
          if a number is missing or needs to be updated, then the updated
          element information is stored in BookStructure.Sections. If an element
          is modified, this is marked with a flag.</li>
     <li> <em>BookStructure.SectionFiles</em> is made to update the files afterwards.
          Therefore, information about all elements that need to be searched and
          potentially modified in a file are stored in a sequential way.
          For every element to potentially inspect the start and end tag is stored.
          Furthermore, it is marked whether the file needs to be modified.
          </li>
     </ul>

<li> In a second phase all files that are marked as "need to be modified" are copied
     to the backup directory and then the file is newly constructed in the book directory.
     This is performed in a simple way: The file is opened as a byte vector and then
     all the element start tags stored in BookStructure.SectionFiles are searched in the
     defined order. Once an element start tag is found, and the element needs to be
     modified, then the element (from start to end tag) is newly constructed and
     stored on file. All parts of the byte vector that need no modification are
     just copied to the newly constructed file. </li>
</ol>
