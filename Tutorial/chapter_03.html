<h1 id="missing-features">Chapter 3 - Missing Features</h1>

<p>
The "makeWebBook" program as of October 2015 is a first step and
several useful features are missing. In this chapter some
extensions are summarized that should be implemented in the future.
</p>


<h2 id="otherCaptions">3.1 Other Captions</h2>

<p>
In web books other caption types might be useful, such as
captions for examples (e.g. "Example 3-1"),
captions for definitions (e.g. "Definition 4-1"),
captions for animations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">webgl</a>
(e.g. "Animation 5-1";  see <a href="http://webglsamples.org/">webgl examples</a>).
It is not clear, how to formulate this.
Currently, &lt;caption&gt; is seen as a caption for a <em>table</em>
(e.g., "Table 3-1: table caption text ") and "makeWebBook" treats "Table 3-1"
as the caption number. It might be better to generalize this and require from the
user to use the right keyword and "makeWebBook" only updates the number.
The tool collects then all captions with the same keyword, such as "Table"
or "Example", and numbers the captions within one such keyword.
</p>

<h2 id="h2-search_button">3.2 Search Button</h2>

<p>
In a pdf-file it is common to easily search for a given string. 
On a web site it is common to search for a given string within the
respective site.
A user therefore expects a <em>search button</em> in the tool bar.
If the book is present on a web page, one could easily use a
<em>Google search button</em>. However, the issue is how to implement
a reasonable search when the book is stored locally on a computer.
</p>

<h2 id="h2-index">3.3 Index</h2>

<p>
Scientific books have usually an index that collects the most important
keywords used in the book together with a reference to the most important sections
where this keyword is used. It would be nice to add such a capability also here.
This should be quite easy: In a text a keyword is marked in the following way:
</p>

<pre>&lt;span id="keyword-id" title="OptionalText"&gt;Keyword&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

<p>
The "makeWebBook" program collects all this information together and then 
generats a separate file (similar as the table-of-contents file)
where the <code>Keyword</code> is present or if a <code>title</code> is used,
the <code>title</code> text. When clicking on this index entry, the browser
jumps to the <code>span</code> element with the corresponding
<code>keyword-id</code>.
</p>

<p>
A completely different solution might be to use a fixed vertical navigation 
bar at the left side. Then the link issue above would be gone and one
could add more navigation possibilities (e.g. list all chapters).
This extension would require a rather small extension of the
"makeWebBook" program.
</p>

<h2 id="h2-ParsingIssue">3.4 Parsing Issue</h2>

<p>
The "makeWebBook" program collects information with the goquery package
that does not distinguish between upper or lower case element/attribute names.
When generating a new file, the file is read again but now a simple search
facility is used to search for the start of an element, such as for
"<code>&lt;h1</code>". Currently, only lower case characters are searched.
Therefore, something will go wrong, if upper case letters are used
for element/attribute names in the underyling HTML file.
This should be fixed.
