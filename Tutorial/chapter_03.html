<main>
<h1 id="missing-features">Chapter 3 - Missing Features</h1>

<p>
The "makeWebBook" program as of October 2015 is a first step and
several useful features are missing. In this chapter some
extensions are summarized that should be implemented in the future.
</p>


<h2 id="otherCaptions">3.1 Other Captions</h2>

<p>
In web books other caption types might be useful, such as
captions for examples (e.g. "Example 3-1"),
captions for definitions (e.g. "Definition 4-1"),
captions for animations with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">webgl</a>
(e.g. "Animation 5-1";  see <a href="http://webglsamples.org/">webgl examples</a>).
It is not clear, how to formulate this.
Currently, &lt;caption&gt; is seen as a caption for a <em>table</em>
(e.g., "Table 3-1: table caption text ") and "makeWebBook" treats "Table 3-1"
as the caption number. It might be better to generalize this and require from the
user to use the right keyword and "makeWebBook" only updates the number.
The tool collects then all captions with the same keyword, such as "Table"
or "Example", and numbers the captions within one such keyword.
</p>

<h2 id="h2-search_button">3.2 Search Button</h2>

<p>
In a pdf-file it is common to easily search for a given string. 
On a web site it is common to search for a given string within the
respective site.
A user therefore expects a <em>search button</em> in the tool bar.
If the book is present on a web page, one could easily use a
<em>Google search button</em>. However, the issue is how to implement
a reasonable search when the book is stored locally on a computer.
</p>

<h2 id="h2-index">3.3 Index</h2>

<p>
Scientific books have usually an index that collects the most important
keywords used in the book together with a reference to the most important sections
where this keyword is used. It would be nice to add such a capability also here.
This should be quite easy: In a text a keyword is marked in the following way:
</p>

<pre>&lt;span id="keyword-id" title="OptionalText"&gt;Keyword&lt;/span&gt;</pre>

<p>
The "makeWebBook" program collects all this information together and then 
generats a separate file (similar as the table-of-contents file)
where the <code>Keyword</code> is present or if a <code>title</code> is used,
the <code>title</code> text. When clicking on this index entry, the browser
jumps to the <code>span</code> element with the corresponding
<code>keyword-id</code>.
</p>

<p>
A completely different solution might be to use a fixed vertical navigation 
bar at the left side. Then the link issue above would be gone and one
could add more navigation possibilities (e.g. list all chapters).
This extension would require a rather small extension of the
"makeWebBook" program.
</p>

<h2 id="h2-ParsingIssue">3.4 Parsing Issue</h2>

<p>
The "makeWebBook" program collects information with the goquery package
that does not distinguish between upper or lower case element/attribute names.
When generating a new file, the file is read again but now a simple search
facility is used to search for the start of an element, such as for
"<code>&lt;h1</code>". Currently, only lower case characters are searched.
Therefore, something will go wrong, if upper case letters are used
for element/attribute names in the underyling HTML file.
This should be fixed.
</p>

<h2 id="h2-Converting_to_PDF_Format">3.5 Converting to PDF Format</h2>

<p>
Sometimes it would be useful to have the web book in pdf format.
This is already now possible but requires manual effort.
It would not require much effort to do this automatically as sketched below:</p>

<p>The first step is to store one HTML file in pdf format. 
There are HTML to PDF converters on the web, but it is unlikely that they 
are useful for scientific web books. For example the commercial 
Adobe Acrobat Pro XI program has a (in principal) nice converter 
for any web page: Clicking in the tool bar on 
"Convert Web Page to Adobe PDF ..." saves the currently inspected 
web page in PDF-format. The program supports HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. 
However, it does not support SVG and not MathML. Therefore SVG images are 
not present in the PDF file and jqmath equations do not look nice. </p>

<p>The only meaningful approach seems to be to print the web page to file 
via a printer driver (only then all elements are contained, including SVG 
images and MathML equations generated internally by jqmath, because the 
web browser renders the page and the rendered page is printed). 
It is sufficient to use any postscript printer driver. These drivers 
usually have the possibility to print to a file as well. The result is 
a file in postscript (*.ps) format. With the open source 
<a href="http://ghostscript.com/doc/current/Ps2pdf.htm">ghostscript</a> 
program ps-files can be converted to pdf. With the open source
<a href="http://www.ghostgum.com.au/">gsview</a> program, the conversion
can be performed from a graphical user interface. In case the commercial
Adobe Acrobat Pro program is available, the generation is very simple: 
In the (Firefox) browser click on "File / Print ..." and then select 
the printer "Adobe PDF". This printer driver generates directly a pdf-file of the current web page.</p>

<p>Generating a page of a web book with a printer driver would not give 
good results, because the (unaltered) rendered page is designed for viewing in 
a web browser. For example, the navigation bar on the left side would be present. 
For this reason, in the "resources/styles/stylesheet.css" file, 
the following statement is present at the end:</p>

<pre>@media print {
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>The CSS3 definitions present in this block overwrite the other 
CSS3 definitions if the web page is printed. In particular it is defined that </p>

<ul>
<li>another font family is used,</li>
<li>the font-sizes are reduced,</li>
<li>the navigation bar and the page heading is removed,&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>the maximum width of images (&lt;img&gt;) is restricted to the
    page width (so images are automatically reduced in size if 
    they would not fit on a page), </li>
<li>page breaks <em>within</em> &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, &lt;pre&gt; elements shall be avoided, and</li>
<li>page breaks <em>after</em> &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, ..., &lt;h6&gt; elements are also avoided.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whenever all files of a web book are merged together in one file (see below), in the &lt;head&gt; 
section of this file the following definition should be introduced:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
   h1       { page-break-before: always; }
   h1.cover { page-break-before: avoid;  }
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<p>
and the first &lt;h1&gt; definition in the cover page should be defined as
</p>

<pre>
&lt;h1 id="cover-page" class="cover"&gt; ... &lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>

<p>
As a result, a page break is introduced before every <em>Chapter</em>,
but not on the cover page.</p>

<p>Additionally, the CSS class <em>page-break</em> is defined in the 
"resources/styles/stylesheet.css" file. It introduces a page break at the defined
location when printing the page. Therefore, whenever the pdf file does not look good,
it might help to use</p>

<pre>
&lt;div class="page-break" /&gt;
</pre>

<p>
in order to introduce a page break.
</p>

<p>With these definitions, the pdf-file generated from a web book file looks usually good.</p>

<p>It remains to generate one HTML5 file from all web book files. Currently, 
this must be done by manually copying all &lt;body&gt;...&lt;/body&gt; elements
in one file and printing this file. It would be not much work to extend the 
"makeWebBook" program with an option to do this automatically.</p>

<p>There are the following remaining (not yet solved) issues:</p>

<ul>
<li> With a postscript or Adobe PDF printer driver hyperlinks are not retained. 
     Therefore, in the pdf-file the hyperlinks are still marked in "blue" but they 
     have no effect (it is not possible to click on them).</li>
<li> In the "table of contents" the page numbers of the sections and sub-sections
     should be present, but they aren't.</li>
</ul>

<p class="bigSkip">
There are professional (expensive) solutions to generate high-quality books from
HTML5 and CSS in PDF format. Especially:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.pdfreactor.com/">PDFreactor</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
From the description it is not clear whether all elements needed for a
scientific web book are supported, especially it seems that MathML and
SVG are not supported.
</p>

<p>
There are W3C working drafts to define the layout of printed books with HTML5 and CSS, especially
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-page/">CSS Paged Media Module Level 3</a> and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css-gcpm-3/">CSS Generated Content for Paged Media Module</a>.
A nice overview with several examples is provided in the web article
<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/01/designing-for-print-with-css/">Designing For Print With CSS</a>. These features are not supported in Firefox version 41 (anyway, the
proposals are working drafts and are not yet released). However,
<a href="http://www.princexml.com/">Prince</a> supports them and is then
able to generate high quality, nice looking, printed books in pdf format.
</p>

<p>
Note, the CSS2 properties <em>counter-reset</em> and <em>counter-increment</em>
to number HTML elements are supported by Firefox and most other browsers.
However, it is an incomplete solution and not sufficient for a scientific web-book.
Even if it would be sufficient, there is the major drawback that the actual
numbers are only visible in the rendered page and <em>not</em> in the HTML
file. This is inconvenient when inspecting/editing the file with a text editor.
